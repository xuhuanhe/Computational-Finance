        calculate the fair_value using DCF model

        1. calculate a yearly discount factor using the WACC
        2. Get the Free Cash flow
        3. Sum the discounted value of the FCC for the first 5 years using the short term growth rate
        4. Add the discounted value of the FCC from year 6 to the 10th year using the medium term growth rate
        5. Add the discounted value of the FCC from year 10 to the 20th year using the long term growth rate
        6. Compute the PV as cash + short term investments - total debt + the above sum of discounted free cash flow
        7. Return the stock fair value as PV divided by num of shares outstanding
